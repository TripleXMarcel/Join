                                When you log in to <span class="join-blue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback”
                            and "Done".

                                In <span class="join-blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
                            added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

                                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card.
                                Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                                etc.</span>

                            <span><b>Moving Cards</b><br>As the task
                                moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                                dropping the card from one<br> list to another.</span>

                                is completed, you can either move it to "Done" list or delete it. Deliting a card will
                                permantly remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                                action is irreversible</span>
