                <h2 id="section3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
                <p>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a
                    valid
                    legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply
                    with
                    laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect
                    your

                    personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more
                    about
                    withdrawing your consent.</p>
                <p>Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance
                    with
                    our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency,
                    exercise
                    or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
                    involved.</p>
                <p>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your
                    vital
                    interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to
                    the
                    safety of any person.</p>
                <h2 id="section4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

                <p>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
                    negotiations

                    business to
                    another company.</p>

                <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
                    privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

                    in
                    this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                    accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
                    personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                    delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
                    personal
                    information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
                    information
                    and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                    applicable legal requirements.</p>

                <h2 id="section7">7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                    standard
                    for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently
                    respond to
                    DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
                    tracked
                    online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
                    inform
                    you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

                    "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make
                    material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of
                    such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy
                    notice
